# Android App: Tour Guide

## Project Information

### About

This app was for my Android Basics Nanodegree. We were instructed to create a tour guide app for a city and implement some type of Android navigation (through a navigation drawer or with a ViewPager) to house different categories that tourists coming to the city might find useful.

### Motivation

I have always had a deep fascination with Japan so naturally I decided to create this app based on cities in Japan that I had visited during my first trip there in 2018. The project submission only called for one city, but I designed the app for four other cities in case the app continues further development.

### Concepts

The main concepts used in this apps development were implementing fragments with ViewPager, using explicit intents to launch tour information for the cities as well as the individual history, places, food, and secrets items, and using custom adapters and ListViews to organize and display the data on the screen.

GravitDesigner was used heavily for the mockups, wireframes, and image effects including the city entries on the first page, the Shinto shrine for the History item backgrounds, and the various picture resources and densities.

## User Interface

I wanted the UI for this app to be very easy to use. I especially wanted the first page to be bold and present a colorful view of the listed cities. Each city housed four categories which housed items in a ListView. I chose a red and white theme for the app based off of Japan's flag colors. The Raleway font used throughout the app gave the app a touristy, yet professional, feel.

## User Experience

To keep navigation in the app simple and familiar, classic Android ViewPager sections were used for users to easily swipe or click to informational categories within a city. The main screen of the app was designed to be bold, yet very simplistic. No other buttons or other forms of navigation are present on the main screen other than naturally wanting to click a city you are interested in.


## FAQ's

Please find below a list of frequently asked questions. For further explanation or clarity, please contact me via [email](mailto:raicalvin@gmail.com).

1. Do all of the cities in this app have content?
> Since the project submission only required 1 city to be populated with tourist information, I decided to focus the app development on Tokyo. The other four cities do not have content populated, but their layouts and code are present in the project files in the case that the app continues development in the future.

2. Is the app available to download from Google Play?
> Since this app for only for a project submission for my Nanodegree program requirements, the app is not available to download via Google Play.
